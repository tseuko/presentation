                    <p><font color="#D8D8D8"><b>Hello, my name is Justin Xie. I was born in an average Asian household. Growing up, I enjoyed building stuff like legos, messing around on computers and playing video games. I enjoyed creating things out of the legos I had. The first games I used to play were on a Nintendo DS; Mario Kart, Cooking Mama, Kirby, Pokemon, etc, with a family friend. The first computer game I played was Roblox back in 2012, and that was when I discovered the possibility to create things in the studio. I was always curious on how games and websites functioned so I wanted to continue studying programming and get a job as a software engineer in the future because of how fun it is to create stuff in code. Thus, this is why I decided to learn coding for Capstone, from no experience.</b></font></p>

                    <h1><strong>What did I learn in 3 months?</strong></h1>
                    <p class="text-intro">
                        I learned that In three months of focused programming, you can become proficient in a programming language and complete a small project like a website or app, and tackle coding challenges by debugging and understanding the mistake. There are also collaboration tools, version control with Git, and basics of databases that I didn't have the chance to learn, as the time to complete my Capstone was limited. <br> <br> I learned web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and explored some frameworks like ReactJS for websites. However, I did not use it since this is just a project for Capstone, and it takes too long to learn everything. I discovered platforms like LeetCode to practice problem-solving, and soft skills like communication. Creating a portfolio to showcase your projects is also a good way for job applications. <br> <br>The principle to being a good programmer is the consistency of practicing and the willingness to learn.

                    <p class="text-intro">
                        As a beginner, programming presents several challenges. Understanding complex syntax, logic, and problem-solving was daunting. Brainstorming ideas about what to do for my website was the longest part. Sometimes there were many things I wanted to add, but it becomes too hard and complicated [called feature creep]. I initially had no idea what to do for my website [this current one], but I managed to pull through and bring out a completed project. <br> <br> Debugging was the most frustrating because I had to scroll all the way back and proofread the code, figuring out what I did wrong forr whatever I wanted to work, not work. My most common mistakes were typos and forgetting to include punctuations/letters. <br> <br> The lack of motivation prevented me from coding, however, I overcame it by doing what I enjoyed, such as coding something fun, and watching different YouTubers, finding the right one I prefer. <br> <br> I learned that overcoming these challenges involved patience, consistent practice, seeking help from my mentor, and breaking down problems into smaller, manageable tasks.

                            <p class="text-intro">
                                My mentor is a Software Engineer who works at an artificial intelligence company called Cognosys.AI. He is also my brother-in-law. He gave me recommendations of languages and frameworks to learn for this project. He went over some terms used, this allowed me to be familiar with what to do and use.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Doing this Capstone project has allowed me to be more familiar with what it is like to code and build stuff. It has opened me up to times of stress and lack of motivation, and ways to deal with them to keep moving forward. This project will help get me a headstart in understanding concepts in post-secondary as my goal is to study as a Software Engineer and land a good job. I enjoyed building this projectand I want to continue doing so. Pursing this path will allow me to enjoy my job as I would be working until I retire.
